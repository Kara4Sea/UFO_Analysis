# UFO Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to allow participants to research UFO sightings using multiple criteria at the same time. The updates to the webpage will now allow participants to filter by any combination of date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results
A participant may use the new webpage to isolate UFO sightings that meet a number of conditions, or may use it to narrow down to locate a specific sighting.

For example, say the participant wanted to find all UFO sightings that took place in the state of Florida. They would type "fl" under "Enter a State", and all rows for Florida would display as filtered.

Say the participant wanted to take this a step further and wanted to filter for all "fireball" shapes that were seen in the state of Florida. They would alos enter this under "Enter a Shape" to filter the additional data.

The participant could potentially go as far as to refine the search to filter each of the five criteria to find a specific sighting. Having these five criteria to search by would become more useful the more data is available to filter through.
